            <h2>Types of Housing</h2>
            <article>When creating a website to help students find accommodation, it's important to offer various types of housing options to provide different preferences and needs. Some types of housing that your website can offer: 

                <ul>
                    <li>On-Campus Housing</li>
                    <li>Off-Campus Apartments</li>
                    <li>Shared lodgings</li>
                    <li>Homestays</li>
                </ul>

                <em>Housing</em> : Many universities offer on-campus housing options, including dormitories and apartment-style residences. Include information about the types of rooms available, pricing, and the application process for on-campus housing. 
                
                <em>Off-Campus Apartments</em>: List any available off-campus rentals or apartments. Include information about the number of beds, the amenities, and the distance from the institution. 
                
                <em>Shared lodgings</em>: In order to save money, some students favor sharing lodgings. Provide information regarding the number of roommates and shared expenses while listing available shared housing choices, such as shared apartments or houses. 
                
                Students who want privacy and don't want to share a living space should be able to find single-occupancy apartments or studio apartments by searching online. 
                
                <em>Homestays</em>: Provide details about chances for students to stay with local families during their studies. Include information on the family, the area, and any meal options offered.
